# SRS
This SRS document was made for a business that I was working with in New York City. In this document, it contains all the work I have done in eliciting requirements, analyzing
them, specifying them and validating them. This document was also made during the end of my junior year in my university as part of a project for a class. This document represents all the work I have done for that class and for my sponsor.
