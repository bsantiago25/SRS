# SRS
This SRS document was made for a business that I was working with in New York City. In this document, it contains all the work I have done in eliciting requirements, analyzing
them, specifying them and validating them. This document was also made during the end of my junior year in my university as part of a project for a class. This document represents all the work I have done for that class and for my sponsor. Also, check out the included link to see the protoype for the software! https://www.figma.com/proto/rKDi6IGCbs4RkZa9jiNbhM/Globex-Payroll-Wireframe?node-id=1%3A2&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1
